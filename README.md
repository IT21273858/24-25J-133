# Mobile and Simulation-Based Approach to Reduce Dyslexia in Children with Learning Disabilities

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a mobile application that assists children with dyslexia in improving their reading, processing, and memory skills. The application will leverage machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), and gamification techniques to create an engaging and personalized learning experience.

## Research Group
- **Software Systems & Technologies (SST)**

## Research Area
- **Machine Learning (ML)**
- **Educational Technology**
- **Assistive Learning Tools**

## Problem Statement
Dyslexia is a learning disability that affects children's ability to read, write, and spell, despite normal intelligence levels. Traditional interventions are often resource-intensive and require trained professionals. A technology-driven approach using mobile applications can provide accessible, engaging, and personalized learning support to children with dyslexia.

## Objectives
### Main Objective
Develop an innovative mobile application that:
- Supports children with dyslexia in enhancing reading, processing, and memory skills.
- Provides personalized and engaging learning experiences through interactive modules.
- Utilizes ML and NLP to dynamically adjust learning content.

### Sub Objectives
1. **Enhance Reading Skills**
   - Implement phonemic awareness training.
   - Integrate text-to-speech, word highlighting, and personalized reading materials.
   - Provide quizzes and exercises with real-time feedback using NLP.

2. **Improve Color Identification**
   - Design personalized color recognition exercises based on ML analysis.
   - Adjust difficulty levels dynamically based on a child’s progress.

3. **Enhance Short-Term Memory**
   - Develop memory training exercises tailored to individual performance.
   - Use ML to analyze progress and optimize training difficulty.

## Features of the Solution
- **Assessment & Personalization**: Initial assessments determine strengths and weaknesses to personalize learning modules.
- **Gamified Learning**: Interactive games enhance motivation and engagement.
- **Multi-Sensory Approach**: Uses audio, visual, and kinesthetic elements.
- **Real-time Progress Tracking**: Parents and educators can monitor performance.
- **Secure Data Management**: Ensures children's privacy and complies with data regulations.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Flutter (for cross-platform mobile development)
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB (for progress tracking and personalized learning models)
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow or PyTorch (for adaptive learning models)
- **NLP**: spaCy or Google’s Natural Language API (for real-time feedback)
